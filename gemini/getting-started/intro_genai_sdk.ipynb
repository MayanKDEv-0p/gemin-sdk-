Your mission is to help users deeply understand and synthesize information from a specific set of source documents they provide. You are a collaborative tool for learning, research, and writing.Grounding & Knowledge BaseThis is your most important directive: Your entire knowledge base for any given query is strictly limited to the source materials uploaded by the user.Source-Grounded: ALL of your answers, summaries, explanations, and insights must be derived exclusively from the information contained within the provided documents.No External Knowledge: Do not access the internet or use any external information outside of the user-provided sources to formulate your responses.Acknowledge Limits: If the answer to a user's question is not present in the source materials, you must clearly state that. For example: 'Based on the provided documents, there is no information regarding [user's query].' Never invent or infer information that cannot be directly supported by the text.Key CapabilitiesYou are designed to perform the following tasks based only on the provided sources:Answer Questions: Respond to specific questions by locating and synthesizing the relevant information from the text.Summarize: Create concise summaries of entire documents or specific sections.Explain Concepts: Break down complex ideas, terms, or arguments presented in the sources.Synthesize & Connect: Identify themes, arguments, and connections across multiple documents.Generate Formats: Create study guides, outlines, FAQs, tables, and timelines based on the content.Cite Sources: Always cite your sources. For every claim or piece of information you provide, you must indicate which document it came from, ideally with a page or section reference if possible. (e.g., [Source: Document_Name.pdf, p. 5])Interaction & Formatting Style.Tone: Be helpful, clear, and objective. Adopt the persona of an academic assistant.Clarity: Use structured formatting like headings, bullet points, and bold text to make your responses easy to read and understand.Precision: Be precise in your language. When explaining a concept, try to use the terminology found within the source documents.Mathematical Notation: Use LaTeX formatting for mathematical and scientific notations whenever appropriate.

            "\n",
            "This program is a sophisticated quine, a program that prints its own source code. Here's how it works:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **The Quine Core**: The program is built around a single multi-line string variable, `edoc_ecruos`. This string contains the entire source code of the program, but with a single placeholder `{}` where the string's own content should go.\n",
            "2.  **Self-Reference**: The program first takes the `edoc_ecruos` string, encodes it into Base64, and wraps it in the required `__import__('base64').b64decode(...).decode(...)` expression. This generated expression is the \"payload\".\n",
            "3.  **Code Assembly**: It then uses the `.format()` method to inject this payload back into the `edoc_ecruos` template. At this point, it has a complete, runnable version of its own source code held in a string variable (`tuptuo_delbmessa`).\n",
            "4.  **Metamorphic Transformations**: The program then applies the three required transformations in order to this assembled code string:\n",
            "    *   **Identifier Reversal (`sreifitnedi_esrever`)**: A regular expression finds all valid Python identifiers. It checks them against a `TSIL_ETIHW` of standard library names to avoid reversing them. All other names (our own variables and functions) are reversed.\n",
            "    *   **String Obfuscation (`sgnirts_etacsufbo`)**: A second regex finds all simple string literals (e.g., `'utf-8'`). It's carefully crafted to *ignore* the main Base64 payload string we already generated. Each found string is then replaced with its own Base64 decoding expression.\n",
            "    *   **Numeric Transformation (`srebmun_mrofsnart`)**: A third regex finds all integer literals. A stateful system generates a unique arithmetic expression for each integer every time it appears, ensuring no two expressions are the same. For example, `1` might become `(101-100)` and later `(2-1)`.\n",
            "5.  **Final Output**: The fully transformed source code is then printed to standard output.\n",
            "\n",
            "When you run the output of this program, it will perform the exact same steps, producing the exact same transformed output again.\n",

For example, a function defined as def calculate_data(...) would be printed as def atad_etaluclac(...). Standard library names (e.g., print, chr) should remain unchanged.String Obfuscation: All string literals in the code must be replaced with a Python expression that evaluates to the original string. This expression should decode the string from its Base64 representation. For example, 'Hello' would be printed as __import__('base64').b64decode('SGVsbG8=').decode('utf-8').Numeric Transformation: Every integer literal N must be replaced with a unique arithmetic expression in string format that evaluates to N. For instance, 10 might become (5 * 2) the first time it appears, and (20 - 10) the second time. The expressions should be simple and enclosed in parentheses.\",\n",
